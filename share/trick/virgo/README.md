## Module Dependencies

This module requires python3.11 or later and the `pip` packages listed in `requirements.txt`. To pull down these packages to a standard python3.11 virtual environment run the following in the directory you wish to create the `.venv`:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip3 install --upgrade pip && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the `.venv` is created, you can source the environment in any shell before running scripts using VIRGO:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
